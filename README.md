# RimorX-Drone
The codes that provide the sensors, Wi-Fi module, and servo functionality in the RimorX Drone project for the NASA/CaSGC internship.

Collaborated with two other people. My main job was the programmer of everything and the one in charge of the electronics.

THE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING CODE IS NOT WRITTEN BY ME. PLEASE SEE THE COMMIT COMMENT OR THE COMMENTS IN THE .ino FILE. IT IS ONLY INCLUDED TO SHOW HOW THE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WAS PROGRAMMED.
